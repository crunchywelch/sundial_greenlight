# Component Weights for Cable Weight Calculation
#
# Weight formula: cable_weight_per_foot * length + connector_a + connector_b
# All weights in ounces.
#
# Core cables are the inner wire before braiding/termination.
# Connector weights include the connector body, solder, and heat shrink.

cable_per_foot:
  GS-6: 0.6      # Canare GS-6 (instrument)
  L-4E6S: 0.6    # Canare L-4E6S (microphone/star-quad)

connectors:
  TS_straight: 0.8    # Neutrik NP2X or equivalent
  TS_right_angle: 1.2 # Neutrik NP2RX or equivalent
  XLR: 1.0            # Neutrik NC3MXX / NC3FXX average
