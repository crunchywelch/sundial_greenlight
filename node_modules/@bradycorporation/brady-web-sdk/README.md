**The Brady Web SDK**

The brady-web-sdk package allows connectivity and the printing of images to supported Brady printers from a web browser.

You may refer to [sdk.bradyid.com](https://sdk.bradyid.com/web_sdk_api/) for detailed documentation of the API.
All available API methods are accessed using this BradySdk object that you will initialize in a script.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Set Up**

1. To install the brady-web-sdk package, navigate to your application's root in a command prompt and use the command:

```
npm i @bradycorporation/brady-web-sdk
```

2. Since the brady-web-sdk is not a Node.js module, importing the module requires users to map the import using the script type "importmap". Refer to [this article](https://dev.to/thepassle/the-javascript-ecosystem-for-the-dazed-and-confused-36il) for more details on these imports.

```
<!-- In the application's index.html/entry point, map the SDK using it's installation 
path to a custom import name. This name is not required to be "brady-web-sdk". -->

<script type="importmap">
    { 
        "imports": {
            "brady-web-sdk": "./node_modules/@bradycorporation/brady-web-sdk/dist/bundle.js"
        }                   
    }                     
</script> 
```

3. To use the SDK, you may now use your import name in a JavaScript file like:

```
import BradySdk from 'brady-web-sdk'
var bradySdk = new BradySdk(printerUpdatesCallback)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Set Up (Alternative)**

When using a web-based framework that does not support "importmap" or the framework does not support this
syntax of import pathing, complete the following steps.

(This alternative method was investigated and proven using the Angular web application framework. These steps might
not work exactly the same in all frameworks.)

1. To install the brady-web-sdk package, navigate to your application's root in a command prompt and use the command:

```
npm i @bradycorporation/brady-web-sdk
```

2. Add the following lines of code to the tsconfig.json:

```
"allowJs":true,
"noImplicitAny":false
```

3. In the code, you may use the following import statement:

```
import BradySdk from '@bradycorporation/brady-web-sdk';
```

**DISCLAIMER:** There might be a warning when using this import statement. This can be ignored and the functionality should still work as expected.
This warning reads: "Could not find a declaration file for module '@bradycorporation/brady-web-sdk'." It may also suggest "Try `npm i --save-dev @types/bradycorporation__brady-web-sdk` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module '@bradycorporation/brady-web-sdk';`". You
should **not** have to do this for the SDK to be successfully initialized and used. 

4. You may initialize the BradySdk class as such:

```
var bradySdk = new BradySdk(printerUpdatesCallback);
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Brady Web SDK is completely dependent on the Bluetooth Web API at the current moment. 
Therefore, [click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API) to refer to all supported browsers. 
All of these supported browsers have been tested including the mentioned mobile browsers.

**NOTE:** The most popular web browser for Mac users is Safari. Since Safari is not supported with the Bluetooth Web API, you may install
any of the supported browsers on a Mac as a work-around.
