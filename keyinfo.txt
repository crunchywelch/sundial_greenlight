Key Classes & Lines
📦 class D (line ~605)

This is the main compression/packaging class.

    Handles transforming print jobs (likely bitmaps) into packets

    Includes logic for:

        Chunking

        Compression (possibly using DEFLATE/zlib)

        Adding metadata or headers

    Possibly converts raster image data into a printable bitmap format (e.g., monochrome)

🧩 class y (line ~398)

    Contains logic for chunk preparation

    Likely wraps the bitmap or command payload into printable segments

📡 printBitmap() function

Used in view_model.js:

bradySdk.printBitmap(imageToPrint, 0.2, 0.0)

    This calls into the SDK and invokes:

        Image → bitmap conversion

        Compression (via D)

        BLE write packet generation

You could trace this back inside the SDK to:

printBitmap(bitmapImage, xOffset, yOffset)

This eventually leads to the creation of a PICL "PrintJob" object, which then uses the classes above to generate packets.
🔐 Output Format

Look for:

    Packet payloads starting with GZIP or zlib headers:

        78 9c → DEFLATE

        1f 8b → GZIP

    Encapsulated in PICL JSON like:

    {
      "PrintJob": {
        "Data": "<compressed_binary>",
        ...
      }
    }
