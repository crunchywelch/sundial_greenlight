<p>There are two basic kinds of knobs, clamp knobs and wrap knobs. The first three pictures show clamp knobs, where the knob is made in two pieces with one or two channels in the top and bottom for one or two wires to fit in. The knob has a central nail that anchors the knob to the the wall or ceiling sandwiching the wires between the two pieces of the knob. Clamp knobs come in glazed and unglazed (shiny or not shiny).</p>
<p>The fourth picture shows wrap knobs, where the wire is not sandwiched between two pieces of the knob but tied around the channel in the one-piece knob. These were often used in conjunction with clamp knobs where the wire had to turn a corner but were also used for running the wires in straight lines. We have encountered maybe one unglazed wrap knob ever in over 20 years of dealing in them. The wrap knobs come in different sizes, as you can see in the picture.  For more information, please see our full description of<span> </span><a href=""/pages/all-about-cloth-covered-wire#g_knob_and_tube"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">knob and tube</a> wiring. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knob-and-tube_wiring"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wikipedia's knob and tube wiring page</a><span> </span>has great pictures of knob and tube installations.</p>

<p>This is a heavy-duty lamp harp available in four finishes, antique brass, dark antique brass, brass, and nickel. It is available in 8-inch, 8.5-inch, 9-inch, 9.5-inch and 10-inches heights.</p>
<p>If you need guidance on which shade is right for your lamp and, therefore, what height your harp should be, see <a href=""https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/follow-this-rule-to-pick-the-perfect-lampshade"" title=""Architectural Digest article on the right size for a lampshade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this article by Architectural Digest</a>.  </p>
<p>Your harp should be the same height as your lamp shade minus the difference between the spider - the piece with arms and a ring in the middle that goes over the harp - and the top of the shade.  You can see the spider as well as a <a href=""/products/finials"" target=""_blank"" title=""finials"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">finial </a>in the picture with the green shade.  So if your shade is 10"" high and the spider is a half inch below the top of the shade, you should get a 9.5"" harp.  If your measurement does not come out to an even inch or half inch, just round up or down.</p>
<p>Please note that the 8.5"" height is not available in antique brass.  Our supplier just doesn't carry it.</p>
<p>Please note that this product is the harp and saddle only. The socket, bulb, and wire are available separately.</p>

It is very well suited to being a bedside light, especially when you mount one on either side of a bed. But it is also very suitable for any place where you don't want to take the space for, or have the expense of, a standing lamp. Since it does not need to be wired into the wall, it is perfect for when you are renting or if you just want to show off the beautiful cloth-covered wire.</p>
<p>This light is actually an IKEA hack, an item made out of an IKEA product but hacked to make it into a something different. The idea came from<span> </span><a href=""http://manhattan-nest.com/2011/08/10/frack-hack/"" target='_blank""'>Manhattan Nest's blog post</a>. The hack is based on IKEA's Fräck scissor-arm bathroom mirror.</p>
<p>You can buy the lamp as a kit and assemble it yourself, or you can have us assemble it for you. You tell us which you would like in the options below.</p>
<p>The kit or assembled light includes:</p>

</ul>
<p>Please note that, while we try to complete assemblies within 2-3 days of when the order was placed, depending on how many you as well as others have ordered, the time for assembly may be more than a week.</p>
<p>One thing that you must tell us if you would like your light assembled is whether you would like the wire to run along the outside of the scissor arm on the left or on the right of the arm. You can see what is meant by this by looking at the picture below. The lamp on the left is wired with the wire on the left. The lamp on the right is wired with the wire on the right.

<p>Four vintage mid-century fiberglass shades, each different but gorgeous together.  They have the lovely quality of authentic mid-century design and materials.  Nothing new can match them.  These would look amazing with all four spread above a dining room table.  They would also be fabulous individually as a bed- or chair-side reading light.</p>
<p>Each pendant is wired with 12 feet of our pulley cord, each with a different but compatible cord giving a great variation when hung as a group.  Each shade is a UNO shade, attached to a dark antique brass UNO dimmer socket (so you can turn the knob on the socket to make the bulb brighter and dimmer), an UNO shade holder, and a rubber rectangular plug.<span> </span>The pendants are lit with our Victorian Edison bulbs (not included, but available<span> </span><a href=""/collections/bulbs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" title=""bulbs"">here</a>). </p>

<p>Knob &amp; tube wire is a reproduction of wire used for house wiring from the 1880s to the 1930s. The wire is called ""knob and tube"" because it was run through porcelain wire clamps, called knobs, to hold it to the wall. The wire was run through porcelain tubes where it was run through the wood parts of the house frame. There is a description and several great photos of knob and tube wiring at<span> </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knob_and_tube_wiring"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wikipedia's knob and tube page</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that this wire is solid core, which means it is one solid piece of copper, NOT made of several finer strands. As a result, the wire is stiff, not bending easily, and holds its shape when bent. The wire is single-conductor with a lacquered, black cotton braid over PVC insulation.</p>
<p>This is a Sundial Wire exclusive, not available elsewhere, and was manufactured especially for replacing existing knob and tube wiring in historical sites, museums, diplays, etc. It is also useful for any application requiring a heavy duty single conductor wire.</p>

<h2>Notes on the Color</h2>
<p>The gold tracer thread which is a subtle contrast with the putty, is not readily visible from a distance. The putty is between tan and gray and is a wonderfully neutral color.</p>
<p>This wire is made with the tracer in order to replicate the look of wire used in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when there was no PVC insulation under the wire to help differentiate the two conductors during the wiring process.</p>

<p><span>Bungalow Cord is our name for this very arts and crafts style pattern and color combination We modeled this wire after a few antique irons we found at Brimfield (a huge antiques sale, which happens three times a year just 45 minutes away from Sundial Wire). The first iron we saw with this wire, and which we bought, is pictured with its rather dirty wire mixed in with the new Bungalow Cord.  We just love this sweet little iron!  An authentic and beautiful wire.</span></p>
<p><span>But please be aware that <strong>our Bungalow Cord is not suitable for use on an iron</strong> or any other heat-generating appliance.  It is not heater cord, which is what you need for such applications</span></p>

<p>The gray tracer, which is a subtle contrast with the gold, is not readily visible from a distance. The gold is a soft gold, close to the color of dijon-mustard. If you are looking for a cord that blends into the background, this is a good choice.</p>
<p>This wire is made with the tracer in order to replicate the look of wire used in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when there was no PVC insulation under the wire to help differentiate one conductor from the other during the wiring process.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This wire is suitable for table-top, floor, and pendant use and suited to many applications, include wiring fans and small appliances.</p>
<p>You should consult a qualified electrician to ensure that the gauge of the wire you select can safely support the electrical load of your lamp or small appliance over the length of wire you are using.</p>
